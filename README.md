# Swift Stream: Building a Social Network with SwiftUI

In this series of tutorials, we'll be creating a simple social network, called The Stream, that allows a user to post messages to followers, chat either 1-on-1 or in groups, and video chat.
Stream's [Activity Feed API](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/) and [Chat API](https://getstream.io/chat/), combined with Dolby's [Interactivity APIs](https://dolby.io/products/interactivity-apis), makes it straightforward to build this sort of complex interaction, with far less overhead than creating it from scratch. All source code for this application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nparsons08/the-stream-swiftui). 

If you would like to skip ahead, [Part 4](https://github.com/nparsons08/the-stream-swiftui/tree/4-video) contains the final completed project.
