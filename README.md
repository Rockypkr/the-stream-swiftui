# Swift Stream: Building a Social Network with Stream and SwiftUI

In this post, we'll be creating a simple social network, called The Stream, that allows a user to post messages to followers, chat either 1-on-1 or in groups.

Stream's [Activity Feed API](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/) and [Chat API](https://getstream.io/chat) combined with Swift makes it straightforward to build this sort of complex interaction. All source code for this application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/psylinse/the-stream-swiftui).

Part 3 contains the final product. If you'd like to skip the tutorials and see the end result, please see the `README.md` in the `backend` and `frontend` directories on that branch to get going. You can find each part of this series by the corresponding git branch or click a link below:
