# Swift Stream: Building a Social Network with SwiftUI

In this series of tutorials, we'll be creating a simple social network, called The Stream, that allows a user to post messages to followers, chat either 1-on-1 or in groups.

Stream's [Activity Feed API](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/) and [Chat API](https://getstream.io/chat/), combined with Swift, makes it straightforward to build this sort of complex interaction, with far less overhead than creating it from scratch. All source code for this application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nparsons08/the-stream-swiftui).

If you would like to skip ahead, [Part 3]() contains the final completed project.

You can find each part of this series by the corresponding link below:

Happy coding!
